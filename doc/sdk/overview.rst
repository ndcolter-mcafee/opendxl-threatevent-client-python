Overview
========

The OpenDXL Common Threat Event Python client library provides a high level wrapper for the Common Threat Event message format.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to receive threat events over DXL without having to focus on lower-level details such as message formatting. 

The :class:`dxlthreateventclient.client.CommonThreatEventClient` class wraps the connection to the DXL fabric and basic processing of threat events.
