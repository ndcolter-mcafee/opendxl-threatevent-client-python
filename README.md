## Overview

The McAfee Common Threat Event DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for the Common Threat Event message format.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to receive threat events over DXL without having to focus on lower-level details such as message formatting.

This client requires an ePO Server instance to be running and available on the DXL fabric.
